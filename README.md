# My Hacking Machine

This is my container used for CTFs. Forked from onemarcfifty/kali-linux-docker.

This container contains additional tools than those default with kali.

## how to use

Configure the exposed ports and user account in ```env```

run
```
sudo ./build
```

Use a VNC, RDP or SSH client to connect to the container.
